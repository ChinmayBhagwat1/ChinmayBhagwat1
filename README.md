## Hi there, I'm Chinmay ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Analyst | Data Scientist | Product Analyst | Business Analyst.

The true value of Data is like a Diamond thats hidden and fossilized underneath the surface. Only a skilled person
can extract and clean off the dust thats covering the true identity of this gem. 

My expertise include SQL, Python, and data visualization tools like Tableau, and Power BI. I love using Machine Learning
algorithms and statistical concepts to gain valuable insights from any kind of data.

My recent work experience was at Applied Materials where I was working as a Data Analyst Intern. I was responsible for developing analytical solutions for product and business
development. I utlized visualization tools to create impactful dashboards for leadership and executives at the company.

I'm currently a graduate student at Arizona State University purusing my masters in Management of Technology with a concentration in Data Analytics.
